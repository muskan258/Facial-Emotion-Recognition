# Facial-Emotion-Recognition
Human emotions greatly influence human actions and decisions. Facial expressions serve as natural signals that can be analyzed through images or videos. However, analyzing emotions computationally is challenging. State-of-the-art classifiers like CNN, ANN, SVM, KNN, and RF are commonly used for feature extraction. Face recognition techniques primarily focus on grayscale images, with limited support for color images. Window-based or pixel-based technologies can enhance performance, but pixel-based methods may struggle to accurately separate the face from other body regions. Overall, addressing these challenges will improve the computational analysis of human emotions through facial expressions.
